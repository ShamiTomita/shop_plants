    - Bromeliad
    - The Vriesea Intenso Orange, or flaming sword houseplant, is one of the showiest
      bromeliads known for its bright orange spike, lasting as long as 3–6 months.
      It is a colorful, easy indoor plant that will brighten up any space. Added bonus,
      it's non-toxic, making it safe to keep around curious pets.
    - 88
    - Thrives in bright indirect light, but can tolerate a few hours of direct sun.
    - Each week, add water to the leaf cups (water tank), the center area created
      by overlapping leaves. As water cups tend to collect debris and insects, empty
      out each week and add new water. Bromeliads can be sensitive to hard tap water.
      Try using filtered water or leaving water out overnight before using. For best
      results, mist weekly and provide an additional source of humidity like a pebble
      tray or humidifier.
